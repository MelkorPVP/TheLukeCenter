##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     I attempted to implement the Google API for looking up values and supplying them to our PHP pages at runtime.
##                                  We need to go through page by page and compare the live site to the test site and adjust both code and front end as needed based on testing.
##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Fixed errors in the way shared PHP variables were being used across the site. I moved them to sharedVariables.php for further ease of maintenance.
##  11/21/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Finished implementing OAuth2 authroization workflows. Got basic form functionality working. It submits, appends row, sends email. Need to fine tune process.
