##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     I attempted to implement the Google API for looking up values and supplying them to our PHP pages at runtime.
##                                  We need to go through page by page and compare the live site to the test site and adjust both code and front end as needed based on testing.
##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Fixed errors in the way shared PHP variables were being used across the site. I moved them to sharedVariables.php for further ease of maintenance.

##  11/21/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Completed a refactor, added logging, moved truly shared application componets to the server root, now lives in 'SERVERROOT/app/...' this creates true
									isolation for TEST and PROD. Also started to give the application awareness of its own environment to help automate testing and to allow the introduction
									of distinct data sources (sheets) that are dynamically based on the environment.
