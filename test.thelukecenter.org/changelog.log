##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     I attempted to implement the Google API for looking up values and supplying them to our PHP pages at runtime.
##                                  We need to go through page by page and compare the live site to the test site and adjust both code and front end as needed based on testing.
##  11/20/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Fixed errors in the way shared PHP variables were being used across the site. I moved them to sharedVariables.php for further ease of maintenance.
##  11/21/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Finished implementing OAuth2 authroization workflows. Got basic form functionality working. It submits, appends row, sends email. Need to fine tune process.
##  11/21/2025  C.Pfannkuch     Completed a refactor, added logging, moved truly shared application componets to the server root, now lives in 'SERVERROOT/app/...' this creates true
##									isolation for TEST and PROD. Also started to give the application awareness of its own environment to help automate testing and to allow the introduction
##									of distinct data sources (sheets) that are dynamically based on the environment.
